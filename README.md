## â†’Challenges in the E-Commerce Landscape

E-commerce has revolutionized the way people shop, but it also presents numerous operational challenges. Othoba.com, the e-commerce of Pran RFL, has been experiencing inefficiencies that impact its overall performance.

From high cancellation rates and delayed deliveries to uneven regional sales and profitability issues, stakeholders have been facing difficulties in optimizing the business. Vendors struggle with logistical inefficiencies, customers cancel orders due to delays, and revenue takes a hit due to inefficiencies in shipment, payments, and pricing strategies.

To address these challenges, a deep dive into the data was conducted, revealing critical inefficiencies and opportunities for optimization. This analysis provides data-driven insights to enhance operations, improve profitability, and refine customer experience.

### Data Source
ðŸ”´Confidential e-commerce database containing order details, customer transactions, delivery records, and profitability metrics.
## â†’The Approach: A Data-Driven Solution

To tackle these challenges, a structured data analysis plan was implemented:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation** â€“ Ensuring the dataset is accurate and reliable for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identifying trends, inefficiencies, and problem areas.
3. **Visualizing Key Insights** â€“ Using graphs and heatmaps to highlight sales trends, cancellations, and vendor performance.
4. **Providing Actionable Recommendations** â€“ Developing strategies to reduce cancellations, improve logistics, and enhance profitability.

## â†’Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before analysis, several data cleaning steps were performed:

- **Handling Missing Values:**
  - `Order Cancel Reason` missing values were replaced with 'Successful Order'.
  - Dropped columns `Product Attribute`, `OrderShippingExclTax`, and `Supplier` due to excessive missing values.
- **Data Type Conversion:**
  - Converted `Order CreatedOn`, `ShippedDate`, and `DeliveredDate` to datetime format.
- **Data Filtering:**
  - Filtered the dataset for relevant time frames.
- **Replacing Erroneous Values:**
  - Replaced `'#REF!'` values in `B2C/B2B` column with 'Corporate'.
